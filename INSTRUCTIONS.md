# Task

For this assessment, you will be building a calculator in React. You are provided with code snippets, and your task is to use these, plus any of your code to complete a calculator app that can perform the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Before you begin

If you execute the `npm start` command before changing any code in this task, you'll get the notification in the code lab's terminal that reads *"webpack compiled successfully"*.

You are now ready to start working on your app. Follow the comments in the code! They are your instructions on what you need to do to make this app work. For example, once you've added the imports, you should be able to serve the app. If still needs work, but at least you'll have the app showing in the browser.

## Steps

In this assessment, your goal is to build a simple calculator app.

The app should be fully functional. However, since you do not have the App.css file in the root folder, you need to add it, with the following code:
```css

Your goal is to use this starting code and extend it with missing pieces to make the app behave as expected: a fully working simple calculator app.
